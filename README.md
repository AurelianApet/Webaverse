## Minimum Requirements

- 10 GB Disk Space
- 8 GB RAM
- 4 Core CPU / vCPUs
- Node version 18+. The recommended way to get node is `nvm`: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

## Installation

**Important note before you clone this repo:** This repo uses Git submodules.
You need to install with the `--recurse-submodules` flag or installation will not work. Copy the code below to clone the repository if you aren't sure.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/webaverse-studios/webaverse.git
cd webaverse/ # Go into the repository
git pull --recurse-submodules # Pull recursively
npm install # Install dependencies
```

## Running

Starting the application is as easy as:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Once the server has started up, you can press the "A" key to visit `https://local.webaverse.com`.


## Installation and Running on Windows

#### WSL

You need to use Windows Subsystem for Linux to install and run Webaverse. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RTSlby-l9w) shows you how you can set up WSL and Ubuntu.

Requirements:
- WSL2. If you have WSL1 installed you need to upgrade to WSL2.
- Ubuntu 20+. Install Ubuntu 20+.

Once you have WSL and Ubuntu set up, run `wsl` in a Windows command window to get a WSL Ubuntu command prompt. Run `exit` at the WSL command prompt to return to the Windows command prompt.

#### Node

At a WSL command prompt, use `nvm` to install Node 18+.

#### Dependencies

Run the following command at the WSL command prompt to install dependencies:
```sh
npm run install-libs
```
<details>
<summary>The following libraries get installed with this command (you can also install manually):</summary>

- libatk1.0-0
- libatk-bridge2.0-0
- libxcomposite-dev
- libxdamage1
- libxrandr2
- libgbm-dev
- libxkbcommon-x11-0
- libpangocairo-1.0-0
- libasound2
- libwayland-client0

</details>

#### Port Mapping

To route all of the needed ports for 127.0.0.1 -> WSL to work locally, run the following command in a Powershell window:
```
powershell.exe .\scripts\wsl-port-forwarding.ps1
```

#### Installation

You can host the source files on either your Windows file system or on the Ubuntu file system in WSL's virtual drive.

**Windows File System:** Run the Git commands to clone and pull source files from a Windows command prompt. You may find this best if you're using programs such as SourceTree as a Git GUI. You can also edit source using your usual IDE.

**Ubuntu File System:** Run the Git commands to clone and pull source files from a WSL command prompt. In this case consider [using the Visual Studio Code WSL extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl) as your dev environment - for features such as hot reload.

#### Running

Start the application by running the NPM command at a WSL command prompt.

##### Pull Requests

Please make sure your PRs change as little existing code as is necessary to prevent upstream merge conflicts.
